# Hour Chalk

A little print-out card game for making weekly tasks.  Cute.  Mostly for prototyping things.  Rips off MTG.

## TODO

These are TODO items for James or whomever.

- The backgrounds of these cards look bad.  Make them better.
- Font?  Maybe a more clear one?
- Make more icons for cleaning, laundry, etc.
- MTG Mana Costs?
- JSON is a crappy way of representing lists, etc.  Maybe there's an easier way to make cards so anyone can do it without these hacks?
- Colors look real janky.
- Haha, AI Images.
